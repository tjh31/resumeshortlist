# Smart Resume Finder
This project aims to assist hiring managers in efficiently ranking and sorting resumes based on job descriptions and skills required using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By utilizing the SpaCy library, the project extracts and analyzes text from resumes in PDF or DOC formats and finds the most matching resumes with given job descriptions.
